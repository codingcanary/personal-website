    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <hr>
<p>My name is Elle Chamberlain which is a....code....name hehehe</p>
<p>I like reading and coding</p>

<p>I am a Junior at Kennesaw State University majoring in Interactive Design minoring in Technical Communication.</p>

<h3>Getting into the world of tech.</h3>

<hr>

<p>I have always been fascinated by technology, and realizing that there is a world where I can partake in all of these interests has inspired me to learn more.</p>

<p>I first grew interested in coding from a friend, his name is Mart and he is now a Java Developer. He helped me realize that it is still possible to learn coding without being a math wizard, that is when I found out about Front End Development.</p>

<p>Here is the website that I use for <a href="https://replit.com">Coding.</a></p>
<p>I am going to begin working on a personal project that will be my very first personal website. There isn't going to be that much on it but some links to follow me on GitHub, Instagram, and possibly Discord.</p>

<h3>Notion</h3>

<hr>

<p>I am a huge fan of minimalism and a clean interface, and a website that I found that satisfites that for me is <a href="https://notion.com">Notion,</a> which is a creative workspace that you can use for just about anything!</p> 
<p>Primarily, I use notion for organization for my classes and personal life. Notion has been something I have grown fascinated with and once I get more knowledge, I am going to attempt to become a Notion Ambassador which is someone that helps people learn Notion, and manage certain things. You can make money off of making templates for people to use, and I believe being an Ambassador is also a payable position.</p>
